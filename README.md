### Just adding blahs to the readme
Blah blah blah.
### What can you expect from this blind teen here?
This blind teen here wil add speech to the iso, this blind teen here wil play around, and this blind teen here wil allways use github!
Nah i actually dont know. I use github now, i am not a "FULL STALMAN" kind of person so i dont quite care that microsoft bought github.
I use windows from time to time so why would i care?
The worst part is when my mum constantly complains that i removed windows and MacOS from my pc and that i am a criminal and that i should be back on the bright side of life!
Nah, she actually doesn't say linux is evil, but she constantly complains.
Back when i had a mac, i removed MacOS and installed linux. My mum finally gave up, told me that i can do what ever i want to but if something breaks dont ask for help, i was like okay! Sure mum!
And that's where MacOS recovery menu came to play. Thanks apple for making an accessible dissaster recovery utility for occasions when arch updates a kernel to 5.5.7 and i hear no speech after upgrading and rebooting and need to reinstall my system.
Well atleast i learned to use linux-lts instid of plain arch linux to avoid dissasters, and i had none since i did that. Now using manjaro with 5.6 and we'l see how it goes, works so far. Anyways, wasn't talking about that. My mum started complaining that i uninstalled MacOS, and when i gave her my comp to doo something she didn't evden know how to open firefox! On mate! Mate rules! Anyways, i needed to help her. Yeah, you herd me right, i needed to help my mum opne firefox! Blind helping sighted XD.
Windows sucks, MacOS is okay and usable and fun, but linux rules!
Moral of the story, i should start writing a blog in readmes xddd
